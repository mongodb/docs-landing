Overview
~~~~~~~~

Products and features that we offer as private or public previews, or any other
type of beta stage, are designed for internal evaluation by our end users. Use these
experimental features in isolated development environments only, never in production
systems or with critical data.

Preview Considerations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Preview and other beta-stage offerings have the following technical limitations:

- Preview features are not production ready.

- Features may contain bugs, errors, or defects.

- You might see unexpected or undesired results in production environments,
  such as data loss and other operational disruptions.

These offerings have the following support and security limitations:

- Preview features are not covered by standard support channels or uptime SLAs.

- Features might not be subject to MongoDB's regular security and compliance frameworks.

MongoDB might modify or terminate preview offerings at any time. If we change or
end-of-life one of these offerings, we do our best to notify users beforehand
but do not guarantee a pre-announcement.
