   :description: Archived MongoDB documentation for products that have reached their end-of-life and are no longer supported.

====================
Legacy Documentation
====================

MongoDB encourages upgrading to the most recent version to
ensure that you can use the most up-to-date documentation and support. 
If upgrading is not possible, legacy documentation is available for
older product versions. Legacy documentation contains archived
documentation for MongoDB products that are no longer recommended for
use. MongoDB does not maintain or update legacy documentation. 

Use the products documented in `MongoDB Documentation
<https://www.mongodb.com/docs/>`__ for up-to-date documentation and
support.
